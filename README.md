# Minesweeper
This is a simple Minesweeper game that can be played on the terminal. It was my very first "major" programming project, and because most of the good programming practices would be taught later in the course it ended up involving a great deal of organization to handle the larger code base.

It was a great deal of fun! Later on I would learn of the the possibility of using external libraries to create better visual experiences, but one step at a time 😅

## How to run
As the code uses pure `C`, you need only compile this code with a C compiler such as `gcc`.

You may run the following code directly in a Linux terminal or using WSL ([instructions on how to install](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)) in Microsoft Windows:
```shell
gcc Minesweeper_for_Linux.c -o game.out
./game.out
```

You could also compile it using the Windows compiler or MinGW, just remember to use the file ending with `for_Windows`.
